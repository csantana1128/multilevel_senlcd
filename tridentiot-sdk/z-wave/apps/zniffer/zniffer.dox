@section zniffer_interface Interface on the DKNCZ20 board

The Zniffer API is accessible via UART either through the USB connector or via the Tag connector,
but it depends on the chosen binary. `.hex` files with "perseus_tag" have the UART
configured for the Tag connector while `.hex` files with "perseus_usb" have the UART
configured for the USB connector.

The configuration of the UART is the same in both cases: 230400-8-N-1

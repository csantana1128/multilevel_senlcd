 *
 * @copyright 2023 Silicon Laboratories Inc.
 *
 * @details All of the functions in this module following the naming pattern
 * CC_UserCredential_<operation>_<object>_and_report are meant to process a
 * request to update the User Credential database and notify the Z-Wave network
 * of the result of the operation.
 * Generally, if the incoming request does not conform to the specification, it
 * will be discarded without any notification. Otherwise, incoming data will be
 * checked against the current state of the database.
 * If the requested operation can be performed and results in a new state,
 * the initiator of the request and the nodes in the Lifeline group will be
 * notified; otherwise, only the initiator will be notified.
